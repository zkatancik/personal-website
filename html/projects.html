            - software engineering intern on Bungie’s distributed build system
            team, responsible for compiling both production builds and
            development iterations of Bungie games.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            - led a key business initiative to modernize the build system
            through containerization. Used Windows Docker containers to host
            build jobs, and developed a client machine wrapper system to
            orchestrate start-up of those containers.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            - converted legacy bare-metal “one job per machine” client machine
            code into containerized code, allowing for multiple client jobs to
            be run per machine and on any Windows system.

            - created a client, server, microservice, and database connection
            capable of serving over 2 million requests in a single 1024-threaded
            client run to support a transaction system for a chain of
            supermarkets. Experimented with both RDS and DynamoDB.
          </p>
          <p class="description">
            - used AWS EC2 Instances and Load Balancing to efficiently handle
            requests and maintain constant throughput even under heavy loads.
            Used a RabbitMQ exchange to serve requests to the database and to a
            microservice asynchronously.

          <p class="description">
            - built a microservice that provides real-time analytics and
            in-memory caching for store and item metrics such as most popular
            items per store, and most popular store for a given item.

            three architectures mentioned above to achieve high accuracy without
            sacrificing precision or recall across all 10 classifications.
