## Elements to satisfy the rubric

### Link
https://katancik.com/

### Pages
As seen in the screenshots below, the site has a landing page, index.html. 

The site includes a header bar for navigation. This header bar contains an external link to github for the project, which opens a new page. As well, it contains two internal links, about and projects. These each contain different pages that exemplify the next requirements on the rubric.

All of the pages are styled with their own css files, with some crossover styling in the mainstyle page that extends sitewide and on the nav bar.

### HTML Table
The projects page includes an html table for displaying my education. This table is styled in css on the projectstyle.css page.

### Interactive JS
On the about page, if you mouseover the portrait in the background, the javascript to display two hidden images runs. These two hidden images should show a mustache and an animated gif arrow on the portrait. 

### Responsiveness and cross-device compatibility
The site was tested for styling on many mac window sizes, as well as two different browsers (chrome and safari) on two different devices (mac laptop and an iphone).
